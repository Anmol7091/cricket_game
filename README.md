# cricket_game
An interactive web-based game inspired by the classic cricket hand game "Bat, Ball, Stump." Players select one of the three options, and the computer randomly chooses its move. The winner is decided based on game rules, with real-time score tracking stored in the browser's localStorage to persist across sessions.
